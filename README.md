# COMP3005-Project
This repository contains the source code, as well as .sql files required to run my bookstore application for COMP3005. This is a GUI application for a bookstore which uses a PostgreSQL database and C# for the GUI itself.

## Implementation
The implementation was conducted in Visual Studio 2019 using C# windows forms applications. Windows
forms is a very quick and easy way to build desktop applications and it works exceptionally well with
PostgreSQL. The color scheme, layout, sizing, positioning, and callback functions were all designed in Visual
Studio. The individual windows for the login page, owner home page, and user home page are all classes, and
can be instantiated.
